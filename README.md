# **BugFixerAI: Automated Program Repair Tool**

## 🚀 Overview
BugFixerAI is an Automated Program Repair (APR) tool designed to detect and fix common backend bugs with minimal manual intervention. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and static code analysis, this tool enhances software reliability by identifying and correcting issues before deployment.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Automate the detection and resolution of backend software bugs.
- Integrate seamlessly with development environments and version control systems.
- Focus on static code repair for efficient and effective debugging.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Targeted Bug Fixing**: Focuses on common backend issues such as:
- **Path & Configuration Errors**
- **Database Connectivity Issues**
- **API Integration Faults**

✅ **Static Code Analysis**: Identifies potential errors without executing the program, ensuring faster and safer bug detection.

✅ **LLM-Powered Repairs**: Utilizes AI-driven code suggestions to enhance debugging efficiency.

✅ **Seamless Integration**: Works with popular version control systems for smooth adoption.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Scan the Codebase**: The tool analyzes the source code for common backend issues.
2. **Identify Bugs**: Uses predefined rules and AI models to detect potential errors.
3. **Suggest Fixes**: Provides AI-driven repair suggestions to resolve detected issues.
4. **Apply Fixes**: Developers can review and apply suggested fixes automatically or manually.

## 📌 Why Static Repair?
- **Faster Debugging**: Detects issues before runtime.
- **Lower Performance Overhead**: No need for application execution.
- **Preemptive Bug Prevention**: Reduces the risk of runtime failures.

## 🏗️ Development Roadmap (1-Month Plan)
1. **Week 1**: Define bug categories and set up LLM integration.
2. **Week 2**: Implement static code analysis techniques.
3. **Week 3**: Develop an interface for reviewing and applying fixes.
4. **Week 4**: Test extensively and optimize for performance.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **AI Model**: OpenAI Codex / GPT-based LLM
- **Static Analysis Tools**: PyLint, ESLint, or custom rule-based analyzers
- **Version Control Integration**: GitHub/GitLab API
